# FLOATS_FileMaker

Steps for running this:

1. Set up the paths and enter your CCMz user/pass in Generate_FLOATS_Config.py and run it. This creates a file with a default name of FLOATS.yaml that will be read in by GetFLOATS_NoUser.py.

 - (alternative method) Modify the provided FLOATS_example.yaml file to suit your needs directly.

2. Run GetFLOATS_NoUser.py. This program assumes a config file called FLOATS.yaml exists in the same directory.
